### About Me


I bridge the world of **networking and cybersecurity**  passionate about how data moves and how attackers exploit it. I enjoy configuring OSPF one day, analyzing Splunk logs the next, and automating firewall rules in between.

My goal? To become the kind of engineer who not only knows how to route packets, but also how to defend them.
